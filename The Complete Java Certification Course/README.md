# Lecture 12: Java Stack + Heap with Reference Variables

There are two memory locations which becomes reserved for the Java application to run successfully, the stack and
the heap.

## Stack

When the Java Application is run, each method invocation is added to the stack from the bottom up within a stack frame.
Every method invocation is added on top of the previous frame, and is removed from the top of the stack once completed.
