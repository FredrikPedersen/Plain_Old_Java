# Topics to look into:

See [Oracle's Exam Topics list](https://education.oracle.com/java-se-11-developer/pexam_1Z0-819) for more info

Topics which should be looked into more closely. You should be able to explain these concepts to someone completely
unfamiliar with them when done.

## Working with Datatypes

| Description | Done | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
|Use primitives and wrapper classes, including, operators, parentheses, type promotion and casting | NO | Am a little uncertain for what they put in the terms "including", "parentheses" and "type promotion". Look into this.|
|Handle text using String and Stringbuilder classes | YES | | |
|Use local variable type inference, including as lambda parameters | | Know what this entails in practice, would have trouble explaining it.|

## Controlling Program Flow

| Description | Done | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
|Create and use loops, if/else, and switch statements| YES | |

## Java Object-Oriented Approach

| Description | Done | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
|Declare and instantiate Java objects including nested class objects, and explain objects' lifecycles, including creation, dereferencing by reassignment and garbage collection| YES | Am pretty solid on this, but should probably work on giving a clear and concise technical explanation |
|Define and use filds and methods, including instance, static and overloaded methods| YES | |
|Initialize Objects and their members using instance and static initialiser statements and constructors| YES | |
|Understand variable scopes, apply encapsulation and make objects immutable| NO | A little bit uncertaion on what they put into "apply encapsulation"|
|Create and use subclasses and superclasses, including abstract classes| YES | |
|Utilize polymorphism and casting to call methods, differentiate object type versus reference type| YES | Re-read definitions of object type versus reference type to be able to explain this concept in technical terms.|
|Create and use interfaces, identify functional interfaces, and utilize private, static and default methods| NO | Get more comfortable with functional interfaces. Look into usage of private, static and default methods.|
|Create and use enumerations| YES | |

## Exception Handling

| Description | Done | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
|Handle exceptions using try/catch/finally clauses, try-with-resource and multi-catch statements| YES | |
|Create and use custom exceptions| YES | Never used an official resource to look into recommended practices for this |

## Working with Arrays and Collections

| Description | Done | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
|Use generics, including wildcards| NO | Am fairly competent with generics, not so much with wildcards |
|Use a Java array and List, Set, Map and Deque collections, including convenience methods| NO | Need to be more comfortable with nuances between Sets and Maps. Have never used a Deque |
|Sort collections and arrays using Comparator and Comparable interfaces | YES | Done many times, can't do from the top of my head. Re-read on this subject.|

## Working with Streams and Lamdba Expressions

| Description | Done | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
|Implement functional interfaces using lambda expressions, including interfaces from the java.util.function package | NO | Know how to use lamdba expressions, but not really why or what happens "beneath the covers".|
|Use Java Streams to filter, transform and process data | NO | Done this loads of times, always have to look it up anew |
|Perform decomposition and reduction, including grouping and partitioning on sequential and parallell streams | NO | u w00t m8 |

## Java Platform Module System

| Description | Done | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
|Deploy and Execute modular applications, including automatic modules | NO | ..ehhh? |
|Declare, use and expose modules, including the use of services | NO | Dipped my toes into modules, but have been mostly working with Java 8, thus never getting a chance to give it a real go|

## Concurrency

| Description | Done | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
|Create worker threads using Runnable and Callable, and mange concurrency using an Executor Service and java.util.concurrent API | NO | Too long since I worked specifically with concurrency |
|Develop thread-save code, using different locking mechanisms and java.util.concurrent API| NO | NÃ¥pe |


## Java I/O API
| Description | Done | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
|Read and write console and file data using I/O streams| YES | I can read and write file and console data, but not very certain on the nuances of different streams, buffers and suchs|
|Implement serialization and deserialization tecniques on Java objects | NO | Did so while in University, never done so since and never really learned why to do so|
|Handle file system objects using java.nio.file API | NO | Can't recall using this before |

## Secure Coding in Java SE Application

| Description | Done | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
|Develop code that mitigates security threats such as denial of service, code injection, input validation and ensure data integrity | NO | |
|Secure resource access including filesystems, manage policies and execute privileged code | NO | |

## Database Applications with JDBC

| Description | Done | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
|Connect to and perform database SQL operations and process query results using JDBC API | YES | Have done a professional project on this, should still look into some more advanced usage of JDBC |

## Localization

| Description | Done | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
|Implement Localization using Locale, resource bundles, and Java APIs to parse and format messages, dates and numbers | NO | |

## Annotations

| Description | Done | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Create, apply and process annotations | NO | Know how to apply, not how to create and process my own annotations |
